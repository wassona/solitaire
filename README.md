<h3>Solitaire</h3>
<h4>Beleaguered Castle is an implementation of the Beleaguered Castle variant of Solitaire</h4>
<p>This project uses JavaScript and CSS to create a web native version of Beleaguered Castle, a Solitaire variant. If you'd like to play but don't know how, fear not! The rules are included.</p>
<p>When I was first learning JavaScript, I built a mostly working version of Klondike Solitaire as a side project. At the time, I didn't quite figure out dragging stacks of individually draggable elements, and I haven't gone back to the project. Beleaguered Castle doesn't allow for moving multiple cards at once, so it was ideal for my skillset at the time.</p>
<p> Shortly afterwards, I was given an assignment in a class to create a timed modal element. Displaying a ruleset for my Solitaire game seemed like an ideal application, so that's the version on display here. I have not yet made it mobile responsive.</p>
<h4>Klondike 1</h4>
<p>Klondike 1 uses the HTML grid element, which currently has very narrow support, in implementing a version of Klondike, the most common Solitaire variant. Klondike 1 does not enforce the rules, and dragging multiple cards at once is not supported.</p>
<h4>Klondike 2</h4>
<p>Klondike 2 is a work in progress, except that it's probably more accurate to call it abandoned.</p>
